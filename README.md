# crud-appl-spring-boot-hibernate
I've successfully developed a robust CRUD (Create, Read, Update, Delete) application using a Spring Boot Maven project in Java. This project showcases my expertise in full-stack development, where I've leveraged the power of Spring Boot to create a highly efficient and scalable web application.

One of the highlights of this project is the seamless integration of Postman API calls to interact with various HTTP methods, including POST, PUT, GET, and DELETE. This allows for smooth data management and interaction with the application.

Furthermore, I've implemented a global error handler to ensure that any unexpected errors are gracefully handled, resulting in a user-friendly experience. This project reflects my dedication to quality software development, staying up-to-date with industry best practices, and a commitment to delivering high-performance solutions
